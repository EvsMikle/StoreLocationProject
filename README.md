At first, it will show clusters of 5000 stores in the MapBox.
So it might take a few seconds to display a real MapBox.
Then you can search stores by input ZipCode and Radius.
It outputs the stores and its information and location on the map which is near in Radius miles a way from the ZipCode address.
